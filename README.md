# SecurInet: The Advanced Network Intrusion Detector
Network security is an essential concern for businesses of all sizes. Ensuring the security of computer networks is crucial in the linked world of today. The goal of this project is to create a highly accurate classifier that can successfully differentiate between ”good” or typical network connections and ”bad” network connections (intrusions or attacks). This will be accomplished by treating the issue as a supervised learning task and classifying network flows as either benign or malicious using the labels included in the dataset. Using Apache Spark Structured Streaming, which offers distributed storage and processing capabilities, data transformation and purification procedures are implemented to guarantee the accuracy of the data analysis. The data is then categorized using a range of techniques that make distinctions between the different sorts of attacks offered in the dataset. The dataset’s relevant subset of attributes is chosen as predictors to categorize specific network flows. To ascertain their viability, conventional machine learning algorithms like k-nearest neighbors and random forest are utilized. The effectiveness of different machine learning methods is also investigated using Spark MLlib, an extendable machine learning framework included into Apache Spark. This project attempts to improve network security and safeguard against cyberthreats that can compromise critical data and interfere with corporate operations. It does this by creating a highly accurate classifier.
